Ever stumbled upon the '**TabError**' in Python? It's a headache that occurs when you mix tabs and spaces for code indentation. This happens because Python's picky about consistent indentation. The *solution*? Stick to either tabs or spaces for indentation, and we'll show you how in this article.
## What is this problem?
### Understanding Tabs and Spaces:
Before we delve into resolving the TabError, let's clarify what tabs and spaces mean in the context of Python code.

**Tabs**: A tab is a single character, represented as `\t` in Python. It's a special *whitespace* character that is used for indentation. When you press the `Tab` key on your keyboard, it typically inserts a tab character in your code. Tabs are used to structure and format your code to make it more readable. In Python, a single tab is typically equivalent to 4 spaces.

**Spaces**: Spaces, as the name suggests, are individual space characters that are used for indentation. Unlike tabs, spaces are represented by the `' '`  character. You can use any number of spaces to indent your code, but it's a common convention to use 4 spaces for each level of indentation in Python.

### Back to the problem:
So, let's get started by understanding the error. In Python, we take our indentation seriously; it's like sticking to the lanes while driving. The **"TabError"** is a glitch that emerges when you mix tabs and spaces for indentation within the same code block. Python wants you to pick one - tabs or spaces - and stick to it. Mixing them up confuses Python, and it raises its voice in the form of a **"TabError."**

## How to recreate this issue?
Recreating this issue is as easy as finding a plate of hot momos in Delhi. Open your Python script, type , and mix tabs and spaces within the same part of your code. Python, like a strict traffic cop, won't hesitate to pull you over with that error.

## Code example
Here's an example to illustrate this tricky situation:
```python title="python"
    def delhi_traffic():
        if True:
            print("Properly indented with spaces")
        else:
           print("Indented with tabs")  # Here's where the mix-up happens
```
## Error message
When you run this code with the mixed-up indentation, you'll receive an error message that says:
```
    TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
```

## What was wrong in the code
Let's break down what's wrong with our code. The issue is that we're hopping between spaces and tabs for indentation. Python wants consistency, just like Delhi's weather during summer - it can't decide between scorching heat and a sudden rain.

## Solutions
Now, let's unravel the solutions to get rid of this `TabError` traffic jam.

### Solution 1: Convert tabs to spaces
One way to tackle this problem is by changing all tabs to spaces. Most code editors have an option to automatically do this for you. Here's how our code would look after the fix:
```python title="python"
    def delhi_traffic():
        if True:
            print("Properly indented with spaces")
        else:
            print("Properly indented with spaces")  # All spaces now!
```
### Solution 2: Use tabs consistently
If you're a fan of tabs, go ahead and use them consistently throughout your code. Here's the fixed code:
```python title="python"
    def delhi_traffic():
        if True:
            print("Indented with tabs")
        else:
            print("Indented with tabs")
```
### Solution 3: Configure your editor
You can configure your code editor to ensure that it uses a consistent type of indentation throughout your project. Check your editor's settings for indentation preferences and set them accordingly.

**User Settings (For all Python projects):**
To set these options for all your Python projects, go to ***File > Preferences > Settings***. Search for "**Python**" in the search bar at the top of the settings window. You should see options for configuring Python formatting. Modify the settings as follows:

- Set "Python > Auto Indentation" to false.
- Set "Editor: Insert Spaces" to true (for spaces) or false (for tabs).
- Set "Editor: Tab Size" to your desired indentation level, e.g., 4.

**Workspace Settings (Per-project):**
To set these options specifically for your current project, create a .vscode folder in the root of your project if it doesn't already exist. Inside this folder, create a settings.json file. Add the following settings to this file.
```
    {
        "python.autoIndentation": false,
        "editor.insertSpaces": true,  // Set to false if you prefer tabs
        "editor.tabSize": 4  // Adjust the number to your desired indentation level
    }
```

Here is an example for the popular editor Visual Studio Code

### Solution 4: Use a linting tool or Code Formatter
There are fantastic tools like *Pylint* or *Flake8* or *black* (code formatter) that can automatically detect and fix inconsistent indentation issues in your code. These tools are like traffic signals, keeping your code organized.

For example, to configure **black** to use 4 spaces for indentation, create a *pyproject.toml* file in your project's root directory (if it doesn't already exist) and add the following content:
```
    [tool.black]
    line-length = 88
    target-version = ['py37']
    use-tabs = false
```
Here is an example for the popular editor Visual Studio Code .Here **Pylance** is acting as a linter. Next image shows popular extensions for python.

### Solution 5: Manually inspect and correct
Lastly, you can go through your code line by line and ensure that you only use tabs or spaces, but not both. It might take some time, but it's like taking the long route to avoid traffic.

Certainly, here's an expanded section that includes all the popular Python linters, along with brief descriptions, installation instructions, and usage examples:

## Popular Python Linters:
Linters are essential tools for maintaining clean and error-free code. Here are some of the most popular Python linters that can help you ensure proper code formatting, detect errors, and improve code quality:

"Sometimes when you're diving deep into the world of Java, and you might get a bug "**Void type not allowed here.**" This bug pops up when you're hoping a function to hand you something, but it decides to ghost you instead. **Quick fix**: either switch up the return type or give that function a solid talking-to until it starts behaving the way you want. Easy, right?

## What is this problem?

So, you're cruising through your Java code, feeling like a king, and suddenly, out of the blue, bam! The "**Void type not allowed here**" error smacks you in the face. It comes when you store output of void function in a variable.

## Reasons for the Error:

### 1. Return Type Mismatch:
```java title="java" {4,10}
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void randomFunc() {
        //Some code here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int x = randomFunc()
    }
}
```
Check the method's return type and change it to an appropriate data type if needed.

### 2. Void Cannot Be Used as a Data Type:
```java title="java"
Void someVariable;
```
Ensure you declare variables using valid data types, not void.

### 3. Void in the Wrong Place:
```java title="java" {3}
public static void randomFunc() {
  //Some code here
  return Void;
}
```
Review method declarations to ensure the correct use of the void keyword.

## How to recreate this issue?

Imagine this - you've got a slick class named "`Main`" you're importing some packages, and there's this method called `randomFunc` that's supposed to showcase some cool details. You hit run, and boom! The "**Void type not allowed here**" greets you like that annoying friend who never leaves your side.

### Code example
```java title="Main.java" {14}
    import java.util.*;

    class Main {
        public static void randomFunc(ArrayList<String> infoList) {
            //Some code here
            for (String info : infoList) {
                System.out.println(info);
            }
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ArrayList<String> details = new ArrayList<>();
            details.add("Delhite ");
            System.out.println(randomFunc(details));
        }
    }
```

### Error message

```
    ERROR!
    javac /tmp/iOM5hc9K81/Main.java
    /tmp/iOM5hc9K81/Main.java:14: error: 'void' type not allowed here
            System.out.println(randomFunc(details));
    ^
    1 error
```

## What was wrong in the code

Here's the lowdown - the `randomFunc` method is a void, It's not meant to give back anything. But look at you, trying to print what it doesn't have. No wonder Java is throwing a tantrum.

## Solutions

### 1. Embrace the Void

Stick to the void, Your `randomFunc` method is all about showing off, not returning stuff. Let it be in its void glory.

```java title="java" {1,10}
    public static void randomFunc(ArrayList<String> infoList) {
        for (String info : infoList) {
            System.out.println(info);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> details = new ArrayList<>();
        details.add("Delhite ");
        randomFunc(details);
    }
```

>When you're dealing with void methods, respect their void-ness. Trying to print what's not meant to be printed will lead you straight into the `Void type not allowed here` territory.

### 2. Change the return type

If you're all about getting something in return, switch up your method. Make `randomFunc` return something, like an `ArrayList<String>`, and then flaunt it.

```java title="java" {1,9}
    public static ArrayList<String> randomFunc(ArrayList<String> infoList) {
        //some code here
        return infoList;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> details = new ArrayList<>();
        details.add("Delhite");
        System.out.println(randomFunc(details));
    }
```

>If you want something in return, declare your method accordingly. Don't expect a void to play by the rules of returns.

>Mind those imports! Importing more than you need is like inviting uninvited guests. Keep your packages in check.


## FAQs

### What is void type in Java?
In Java, `void` is a keyword used as a return type for methods to indicate that the method does not return any value. Void methods are meant for performing actions rather than producing results.

### Is void a return type or not?
Yes, void is a return type in Java, but it signifies that the method does not return any value. It is used for methods that perform actions without producing a result.
 
## Conclusion

There you have it, The "**Void type not allowed here**" bug stands no chance against your code skills. Whether you're embracing the void or turning to other return types, you're now armed to tackle it head-on. Keep coding, keep sipping that cutting chai, and may your code always be bug-free!
